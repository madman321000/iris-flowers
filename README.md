This is a simple program to classify the iris flower dataset.

First the dataset is loaded into a dataframe. Then I did some graphs of the dataset to see how the classifications are spread out. First there was a box and whisker plot and then a histogram. After that I did a scatter matrix to see if there is a predictable relationship. Then the dataset was split into a training set 80% and a validation set 20%. Then the data was used with all these models Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)., Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM). And in the end I created a plot to see the most accurate algorithm.
